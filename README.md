# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Project Overview

Pewlett Hackard has a suspected large number of employees approaching retirement. This project determines the number of employees leaving based on title and department. With the large amount of talent leaving, it is important to identify employees with similar talent who can mentor the large number of new hires coming in to replace retiring employees. Employees eligible for the mentorship program have also been categorized by title and department.
